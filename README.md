Netflix Clone Built with React.js & Firebase
This project is a Netflix clone developed using React.js for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. While it doesn't replicate all the features of the original Netflix website, it showcases a similar design and functionality, highlighting my skills in building advanced web applications with React.js. The clone includes a home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and a basic movie player.
