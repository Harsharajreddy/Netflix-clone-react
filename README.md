# Netflix Clone Built with React.js & Firebase

This project is a Netflix clone developed using **React.js** for the frontend and **Firebase** for the backend. While it doesn't replicate all the features of the original Netflix website, it showcases a similar design and functionality, highlighting my skills in building advanced web applications with React.js. The clone includes a home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and a basic movie player.
